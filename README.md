The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the way we interact with our
surroundings by integrating smart devices into our daily lives. In line with
this technological advancement, our project aims to develop a smart doorbell
system. This system not only enhances security but also provides a
convenient way to manage access to oneâ€™s home or office remotely.
